Page Counting and Page Numeration (you know, how the pages are being counted and stuff):

Numbers are at the bottom middle or bottom left
Front Page counts as Page 1 but has no Number at the bottom
Structure counts as Page 2 but has no Number at the bottom aswell
Everything else has normal Page Numbers
Last page is Bibliography

Structure:
Structure has to be written in a unified outline scheme

I need three references written as books, other three can be websites or other secondary literature
File FRONTPAGE.docx (or FRONTPAGE.pdf) has to be the first page of the document.
Final result as a .docx or LaTeX document, if possible.
